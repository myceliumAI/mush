# Juju Bastion Terraform Module

Provision a lightweight Compute Engine VM on Google Cloud that acts as a *Juju* bastion host. The instance fetches a Kubernetes `kubeconfig` from Secret Manager at boot, allowing you to interact with your cluster through Juju.

## Features

- Creates a service account with minimum IAM permissions.
- Deploys a single VM instance with a configurable machine type and image.
- Injects a startup script that installs Juju and retrieves the `kubeconfig` secret.
- Exposes helpful outputs such as the instance name and public IP address.

## Usage

```hcl
module "juju_bastion" {
  source = "./tf-modules/juju" # adjust path as needed

  # Required variables
  name                  = "juju-bastion"
  zone                  = "europe-west1-b"
  project_id            = "my-gcp-project"
  kubeconfig_secret_id  = "projects/123456/secrets/k3s-kubeconfig"
  kubeconfig_secret_name = "k3s-kubeconfig"

  # Optional overrides
  machine_type              = "e2-small"   # default
  image                     = "ubuntu-os-cloud/ubuntu-2204-lts" # default
  juju_service_account_name = "juju-bastion-sa" # default
}
```
